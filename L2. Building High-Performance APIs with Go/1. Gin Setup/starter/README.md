# Exercise: Setting Up a Basic Gin Project

In this exercise, you'll practice setting up a basic Gin project from scratch. You will install the Gin framework, create a simple project structure, and build a basic web server that handles a single route. This exercise will give you hands-on experience with installing and running a Gin application.

First, navigate to **/L2. Building High-Performance APIs with Go/1. Setting Up a Project/starter/main.go**.

## Instructions

1. Install Gin. Use `go get` to install the Gin package. Refer to the TODO in the starter code for where to add the import statement and install Gin.

2. Create a `main.go` file for the server.

3. Create a basic server with Gin that listens on port `8080`.

4. Define a route for `GET /` that responds with a simple text message (e.g., "Hello, Gin!").

5. Run the Gin server and test the endpoint by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser or using a tool like Postman or cURL.
