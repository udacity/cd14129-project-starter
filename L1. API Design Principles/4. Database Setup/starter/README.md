# Exercise: Database Setup

In this exercise, you'll practice establishing a database connection in Go using GORM and PostgreSQL. You'll declare and configure the database connection, then auto-migrate a simple model to the database.

First, navigate to **/L1. API Design Principles/4. Database Setup/starter/main.go**.

## Instructions

1. Declare the database connection. Add the necessary code to declare a global variable for your GORM database connection (see the `TODO` in the starter code).

2. Configure a connection to a PostgreSQL database using GORM. Write the code to set up the connection to the PostgreSQL database. Refer to the `TODO` in the starter code.

3. Auto-migrate the model to the database. Complete the `TODO` in the starter code to auto-migrate the `Task` model.
