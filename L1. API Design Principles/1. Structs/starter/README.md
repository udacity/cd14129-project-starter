# Exercise: Structs

In this exercise, you'll practice creating a struct and adding methods to work with it.

First, navigate to **/L1. API Design Principles/1. Structs/starter/main.go**.

## Instructions:

1. Create a struct called `Rectangle` with two fields: ` Width` and `Height` (both of type `float64`).
2. Define a method for the `Rectangle` struct called `Area()`, which calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
3. Define another method for the `Rectangle` struct called `Perimeter()`, which calculates and returns the perimeter of the rectangle.
4. In the `main()` function, create a new `Rectangle` with a width of `5.0` and a height of `10.0`.
5. Print out the area and perimeter of the rectangle using the methods you've defined.
